## Moral value
The moral message we get from Rebecca The Maasai's story is almost the same as Michael Jackson's song Heal The World, here are some snippets of lyrics from the song

 There's a place in your heart
 And I know that it is love
 And this place it was brighter than tomorrow
 And if you really try
 You'll find there's no need to cry
 In this place you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow

 There are ways to get there
 If you care enough for the living
 Make a little space
 Make a better place

 Heal the world
 Make it a better place
 For you and for me, and the entire human race
 There are people dying
 If you care enough for the living
 Make a better place for you and for me

> The song tells how prosperous mankind is if they can love others, the point is "when you do good, no matter what you do, there's a miracle in there"
