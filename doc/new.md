a hat or glasses. Your mask should also fit your face because any gap allows the virus to escape. No

There are plenty of ways to get a good fit. Look for masks that come in different sizes and find the
one that fits your face. Adjust the straps around your ears or head for a snug fit. Look for a mask with
a flexible nose piece. Here's what to check.

No gaps at the sides, no gaps at the nose, and no gaps around the chin. Now breathe normally. Is it
comfortable? If not, find another one. If it is comfortable, make sure when you blow hard, the air stays
